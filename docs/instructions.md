# Instructions

## The Process

### Define the Problem

As we discuss the good and bad points of Tic-Tac-Toe, make some notes. The bad points could be the seeds of ideas about how to fix the game, and the good points will help you to keep the character of the game intact.

You may also find it useful to write out the rules of the game - they can help you think about what you could change.

### Brainstorm New Or Modified Mechanics

Collect as many ideas as you can for possible changes to the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Don't stress over this, but don't just go with your first idea. New ideas will come to you unexpectedly, when they come, write them down.

### Make a Prototype

Pick a new mechanic that seems promising and add it to the game. Try it with your partner to see if it works and seems like a viable change.

### Playtest

Before "getting serious" about testing, make some notes about what should be different about the game. For example:
- The person who goes first doesn't control the game.
- The game lasts longer.
- Equally matched players don't always draw.
- Etc.

Then, try out the game with "naive" players. How does it work? What needs to be changed or tuned?

### Iterate

Decide what to change and repeat.
