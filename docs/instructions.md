# Instructions

### Define the Problem

As we discuss the good and bad points of Tic-Tac-Toe, make some notes. The bad points could be the seeds of ideas about how to fix the game, and the good points will help you to keep the character of the game intact.

You may also find it useful to write out the rules of the game - they can help you think about what you could change.

### Brainstorm New Or Modified Mechanics

Collect as many ideas as you can for possible changes to the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Don't stress over this, but don't just go with your first idea. New ideas will come to you unexpectedly, when they come, write them down.

### Do Some Quick Tests

Pick a new mechanic that seems promising and add it to the game, then test it out with your partner:
* Can you describe how it works (write a rule)?
* Does it seem to work?
* Does it seem like an improvement?

Iterate if the test reveals problems with your mechanic.

### Make a Prototype

Once you have a new version of Tic-Tac-Toe,
use the [sample instructions][] as a model, and write up the instructions for the game. We will use these when we playtest. **Be sure that your instructions include: the names of the designers, the block of your class, and the title of your game.**
